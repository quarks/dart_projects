    <h1>Collision Clones</h1>

    <p>
 This game shows a field of moving cars of different sizes and colors.
 The player controls the red car (initially at the upper left top) through the mouse cursor.
 The objective is to move the red car within the time limit with as few collisions as possible.
 The lower the speed limit, the slower the cars.
 The game runs until the time limit (in min).
 You lose if during that time the number of collisions is greater than the time elapsed in seconds,
 you win if you survive the time limit.
 If the red car is hit, it shrinks to a little black car;
 in order to revive it, move the cursor to one of the borders of the diagram.
 After a certain number of collisions clone cars appear. .</p>
