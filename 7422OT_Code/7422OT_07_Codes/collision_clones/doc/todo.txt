To do

+ collision counts only updated after red car is renewed (from small to big)
+ check the rapid increase in collisions (only when the red car is small)
+ check the red car position when far south and east
+ check car collisions for better avoidance
+ use images for cars
+ rotate a car to follow its move direction
+ parametrize when a new car will appear after a certain number of collisions
