## Simple Todo App using IndexedDB

A port of the Todo example used in the
[A Simple TODO list using HTML5 IndexedDB](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem/)
article by Paul Kinlan, originally published on HTML5Rocks.

The example demonstrates how to create a very simple todo
list manager using IndexedDB.

IndexedDB is a data store that developers can use to store and manipulate data
on the client side. IndexedDB is usually used as an Asynchronous API where the
data is delivered to a defined callback function.

You can open the example in Dart Editor and run it by clicking `index.html`.
Or, you can try this
[live demo](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/indexeddb/todo/).
