## Using the File API

A Dart port of the Files API examples used in the
[Reading files in JavaScript using the File APIs](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/dndfiles/)
article by Eric Bidelman, originally published on HTML5Rocks.

The examples show how to select a file using a form input, or using drag and
drop. See how you can slice a file in separate byte range
chunks for efficient uploading, and monitor progress while uploading a file.

You can try this
[live demo](http://www.dartlang.org/samples/dndfiles/).

Please report any [bugs or feature requests](http://dartbug.com/new).
