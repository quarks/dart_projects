## Exploring the FileSystem APIs

A port of the FileSystem example used in the
[Exploring the FileSystem APIs](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem/)
article by Eric Bidelman, originally published on HTML5Rocks.

With the FileSystem API, a web app can create, read, navigate, and write to a
sandboxed section of the user's local file system.

You can open the example in Dart Editor and run it by clicking `index.html`.
Or, you can try this
[live demo](http://www.dartlang.org/samples/filesystem/).

Please report any [bugs or feature requests](http://dartbug.com/new).
