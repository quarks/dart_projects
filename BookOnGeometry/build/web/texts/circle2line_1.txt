Press and drag the mouse to define the line. Clicking the mouse will create a random line.
If both ends of the line are within the circle there is no intersection. If one end of the line is inside and the other outside the circle then there is a single intersection point.
If both ends of the line are outside the circle then there may be two intersection points, a single intersection point (line is a tangent) or no intersection points.
Intersection points are show as red dots.
