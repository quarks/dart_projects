As the point moves it calculates the nearest position on the line. This is the point where the line-normal from the point intersects the line. For an infinite line there will always be a point and this is highlighted in purple, for a finite line this is not always the case but when true the point will be highlighted in blue. The coordinates for this point are also calculated and displayed. The number in red is the shortest distance between the point and the line, if the distance is <= 1.0 then the point is considered to be 'near the line' this property can be used by a graphics program to enable lines to be selected. The legend in the top left will indicate when the point is considered near enough to the lines.
Notice that the position of the text changes depending on which side of the line the point is, the two sides are called 'inside' and 'outside'. If you pin the starting position of the line and then sweep the end position in a clockwise direction, then the area in front of the line is considered the 'outside' and the area behind the line the 'inside'.
