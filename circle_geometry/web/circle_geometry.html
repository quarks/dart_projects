  <h3>Circle - line intersection</h3>
  <div id="canvas_container_id">

  </div>
  <p>Press and drag the mouse to define the line. Clicking the mouse
    will create a random line.</p>
  <p>If both ends of the line is within the circle there is no
    intersection. If one end of the line is inside and the other outside
    the circle then there is a single intersection point.</p>
  <p>If both ends of the line are outside the circle then there
    meybe two intersection points, a single intersection point (line is
    a tangent) or no intersection points.</p>
  <p>Intersection points are show as red dots.</p>




  <h3>Tangents to a circle from a point</h3>
  <div id="canvas_container_id">
    <canvas id="circ2circ_c" width="256" height="256"></canvas>
  </div>


  <h3>Tangents between circles</h3>

  <div id="canvas_container_id">
    <canvas id="circ2circ_a" width="256" height="256"></canvas>
  </div>
  <p>The green circle will be centered about the mouse as it moves.</p>
  <p>
    The lines between the circles are tangents to both circles. If the
    circles do not intersect then there are 4 tangents, if they
    intersect then there are just 2, the <i>outer</i> tangents. If one
    circle completely covers the other circle then there are no
    tangents.
  </p>
  <p>When two circles intersect then the intersecion points are
    shown as red cicles. Normally there will be two intersection points
    but if the circles are just touching then there will be just one.</p>
