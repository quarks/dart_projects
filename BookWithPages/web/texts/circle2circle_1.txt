The green circle will be centered about the mouse as it moves.
The lines between the circles are tangents to both circles. If the circles do not intersect then there are 4 tangents, two outer tangents (purple) and two inner tangents (orange). If the two circles intersect then there are no inner tangents but there will be 1 or 2 intersection points (red spots). The single intersection point is when the two circles are just touching.
If one circle completely covers the other circle then there are no tangents.
